This repository contains the source-codes and the analysis results of the study we conducted to assess ONNX and CoreML for converting trained DL models. Two popular DL frameworks, Keras and PyTorch, are used to train five widely used DL models on three popular datasets. The trained models are then converted to ONNX and CoreML.
